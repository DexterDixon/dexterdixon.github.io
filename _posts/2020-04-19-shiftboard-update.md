I made a custom PCB for ShiftBoard using an STM32 microcontroller. After initially testing out the prototype for ShiftBoard using prototyping electronics, we decided it was time to start making our own custom parts. In addition to using the STM32 microcontroller, I used four load cell amplification circuits, a buck converter, PWM for two brushless motor controllers, a Bluetooth module, and a USB for debugging.

I’ve posted 3 timelapse recordings of me making the schematic, the board, then optimizing the board using Eagle CAD. In addition to this PCB, I also made a flexible PCB to go on our custom load cells that will allow us to connect our strain gauges in a way for us to get accurate weight data. Below is the first part of the three videos. Be sure to go to my YouTube page to see the other two!
