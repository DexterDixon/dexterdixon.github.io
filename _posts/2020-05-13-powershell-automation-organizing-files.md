I wanted to spend some time getting myself more familiar with PowerShell scripting. So I started with creating a script that automatically organizes files. The script checks all the files on your desktop and all the files in your downloads folder and begins to move them to the appropriate location by file type.

Everyone has a problem with a messy desktop and unorganized downloads folder, and I wanted to make something that I would actually use. I plan on posting a tutorial video on how I made it to my YouTube channel, so be sure to check it out here and subscribe to be notified when I post the video!
