I posted a timelapse video of me making a Twitter bot using Selenium in Python. Selenium is a Python API that many people use for web-based automation. I wanted to familiarize myself with Selenium, so I decided to use it to create a Twitter bot that logs into your account and lets you know who you are following that’s not following you back. I recorded the whole process so that I could post it onto my YouTube channel. So give the video a like and subscribe to my channel as I will be posting my content.

The code is also on my Github page [Link](https://github.com/DexterDixon/Twitter-Bot)
