I’ve recently started studying for my CompTIA Security + exam, and I decided that I want to expand my Python skills by doing a few projects. Since I am learning about different types of threats, I decided that the first place to start would be with a keylogger.

This helped to familiarize me with a few libraries like the subprocess, pynput, email, and SMTP libraries. The program itself is pretty simple and consists of 6 functions and a timed loop that determines how long the program will remain active before sending the information back to a source via email.

In the future, I plan on writing some automation programs in Python using Selenium and PythonAutoGUI libraries and then some Bash and/or PowerShell scripting. All of the code for my Keylogger is on my Github page, and I’ve added comments. If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
